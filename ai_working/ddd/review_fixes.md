## zen-architect Review Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ⚠️ Approve with Minor Changes

The zen-architect identified 4 Important issues and 4 Minor issues. All Important issues have been fixed.

---

## Important Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Retcon Writing Violations in workflows.md

**Issue**: Future-tense language ("future enhancement", "Planned workflows")

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed "future enhancement" comment from optimization section (line 218)
- Deleted entire "Future Workflows" section (lines 240-248)

**Philosophy**: YAGNI - We don't document what we're NOT doing or WILL do

---

### ✅ 2. Retcon Writing Violations in architecture.md

**Issue**: "Future Enhancements" section with "Planned" and "Not Planned (YAGNI)" subsections

**Fixes Applied**:
- Deleted entire "Future Enhancements" section (lines 223-238)
- Removed both "Planned (Not Yet Implemented)" and "Not Planned (YAGNI)" subsections

**Philosophy**: Documentation describes what EXISTS now, not future plans

---

### ✅ 3. Project URL Inconsistency in CHANGELOG.md

**Issue**: URLs referenced `github.com/amplifier/orchestrator` instead of `rzp-labs`

**Fixes Applied**:
```diff
-[Unreleased]: https://github.com/amplifier/orchestrator/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD
-[0.1.0]: https://github.com/amplifier/orchestrator/releases/tag/v0.1.0
+[Unreleased]: https://github.com/rzp-labs/orchestrator/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD
+[0.1.0]: https://github.com/rzp-labs/orchestrator/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```

**Ownership**: Correct attribution to rzp-labs

---

### ✅ 4. DRY Violation: Ruff Configuration Duplication

**Issue**: Configuration duplicated between `ruff.toml` and `pyproject.toml[tool.ruff]`

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Consolidated ALL ruff configuration into `pyproject.toml`:
   - Added additional linters from ruff.toml (B, C4, SIM)
   - Added format settings (quote-style, indent-style, line-ending)
   - Added E501 to ignore list
   - Updated per-file-ignores to match ruff.toml
2. Deleted `ruff.toml` entirely
3. Updated `docs_index.txt` to remove ruff.toml from file list

**Philosophy**: Single Source of Truth from AGENTS.md - all Python project config in pyproject.toml

**Final pyproject.toml [tool.ruff] section**:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py311"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",   # pycodestyle errors
    "W",   # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",   # pyflakes
    "I",   # isort
    "UP",  # pyupgrade
    "B",   # flake8-bugbear
    "C4",  # flake8-comprehensions
    "SIM", # flake8-simplify
]
ignore = [
    "E501",  # Line too long (handled by formatter)
]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"__init__.py" = ["F401"]  # Allow unused imports
"tests/**/*.py" = ["E501", "SIM"]  # Relax rules in tests

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
line-ending = "lf"
```

## Minor Issues (Not Fixed - Optional)

### 5. Ambiguous Language in README.md:153
- Current: "Built following the Amplifier framework"
- Suggested: "Built using the Amplifier framework for AI-powered development"
- **Decision**: Keep current - it's clear enough

### 6. Inconsistent Terminology
- "rzp-labs" consistently hyphenated throughout
- **Status**: Already consistent

### 7. Missing Context in setup.md:62
- Could add comment about workspace pattern
- **Decision**: Not critical, defer

### 8. Verbose Progress Examples
- Could simplify workflow output examples
- **Decision**: Detailed examples are helpful

## zen-architect Final Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED - Ready for Phase 3**

**Rationale**:
- All Important issues fixed
- Philosophy compliance strong (ruthless simplicity, modular design)
- Retcon writing now clean (no future tense)
- Configuration properly consolidated (Single Source of Truth)
- Project ownership clear (rzp-labs, not Microsoft/Amplifier)

**Next Step**: Proceed to Phase 3 (Code Planning) with `/ddd:3-code-plan`
