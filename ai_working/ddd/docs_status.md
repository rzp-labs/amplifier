# Phase 2: Non-Code Changes Complete

## Summary

Created complete documentation and configuration for the **Orchestrator** submodule - an AI-powered orchestrator for tactical product development work. All files written using retcon style (present tense, as if already exists).

**Total files created**: 15
- 13 orchestrator files (new submodule)
- 2 amplifier files (updates)

## Files Changed

### New Orchestrator Submodule

**Documentation** (6 files):
- `orchestrator/README.md` - Main entry point with overview and quick start
- `orchestrator/docs/setup.md` - Complete installation and configuration guide
- `orchestrator/docs/workflows.md` - Support triage workflow documentation
- `orchestrator/docs/architecture.md` - Design decisions and patterns
- `orchestrator/docs/adding_workflows.md` - Guide for creating new workflows
- `orchestrator/docs/hooks_and_skills.md` - Claude Code integration patterns

**Configuration** (7 files):
- `orchestrator/pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies (uv-managed, aligned with amplifier)
- `orchestrator/ruff.toml` - Ruff linting/formatting configuration
- `orchestrator/package.json` - Node dependencies (pnpm for shfmt)
- `orchestrator/Makefile` - Standard commands (install, check, test, format-sh)
- `orchestrator/.gitignore` - Python, node, logs, IDE files
- `orchestrator/LICENSE` - MIT License
- `orchestrator/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

### Updated Amplifier Files

**Documentation** (1 file):
- `README.md` - Added "Submodules" section describing orchestrator

**Configuration** (1 file):
- `.gitmodules` - Registered orchestrator as git submodule

## Key Changes

### orchestrator/README.md

**What changed**:
- Created main entry point with project overview
- Added quick start guide with prerequisites
- Documented support triage workflow
- Explained architecture pattern
- Linked to detailed documentation

**Retcon approach**: Written as if orchestrator already exists and is fully functional

### orchestrator/docs/setup.md

**What changed**:
- Complete installation guide (uv, linear-cli, Claude Code SDK)
- Configuration steps (Linear authentication, environment variables)
- Verification steps with real examples
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Development setup for contributors

**Retcon approach**: All commands and steps work now (present tense)

### orchestrator/docs/workflows.md

**What changed**:
- Detailed documentation of support triage workflow
- Step-by-step explanation of how it works
- Performance metrics and error handling
- Usage examples with expected output
- When to use vs when not to use

**Retcon approach**: Workflow exists and is fully operational

### orchestrator/docs/architecture.md

**What changed**:
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Module structure explanation
- Design decisions with user quotes as justification
- Technology stack documentation
- Philosophy alignment verification

**Retcon approach**: System is built and working as documented

### orchestrator/docs/adding_workflows.md

**What changed**:
- Guide for creating new workflows
- Code examples and patterns
- Best practices for defensive utilities
- Testing approach
- Integration with existing system

**Retcon approach**: System is extensible and ready for new workflows

### orchestrator/docs/hooks_and_skills.md

**What changed**:
- Explanation of Claude Code hooks pattern
- How orchestrator uses hooks (following amplifier)
- Examples and implementation details
- Metrics collection approach
- Clear distinction: Python for orchestration, hooks for logging

**Retcon approach**: Hooks are implemented and working

### orchestrator/pyproject.toml

**What changed**:
- Dependencies aligned with amplifier versions exactly
- uv-managed configuration
- pytest, ruff, pyright configuration
- Project metadata and scripts

**Key**: All dependencies match amplifier for consistency

### README.md (amplifier)

**What changed**:
- Added "Submodules" section before "Disclaimer"
- Documented orchestrator with quick start
- Linked to orchestrator documentation

**Integration**: Orchestrator presented as part of amplifier ecosystem

### .gitmodules

**What changed**:
- Registered orchestrator as git submodule
- Path and URL configuration

**Purpose**: Makes orchestrator a proper git submodule

## Deviations from Plan

**None** - All documentation follows the plan exactly:
- Manual invocation (not automated polling)
- Python for orchestration
- Hooks for logging (amplifier pattern)
- CLI tools over MCP
- Defensive utilities for LLM handling
- Standard tooling (uv, ruff, pnpm, shfmt)

## Approval Checklist

Please review the changes:

- [x] All affected docs updated?
- [x] Retcon writing applied (no "will be")?
- [x] Maximum DRY enforced (no duplication)?
- [x] Context poisoning eliminated (no conflicts)?
- [x] Progressive organization maintained (overview → details)?
- [x] Philosophy principles followed (ruthless simplicity, modular design)?
- [x] Examples work (could copy-paste and use after implementation)?
- [x] No implementation details leaked into user docs?

## Verification Results

**Retcon writing**: ✓ No future tense found ("will be", "coming soon", "planned")
**Cross-references**: ✓ All links present and properly formatted
**Terminology**: ✓ Consistent use of "orchestrator", "submodule", "workflow"
**Philosophy**: ✓ Aligned with ruthless simplicity and modular design

## Git Status

Changes ready for review. Not yet committed (awaiting approval).

## Next Steps After Approval

1. **Stage all changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/stephen/amplifier
   git add orchestrator/ README.md .gitmodules
   ```

2. **Review the diff** (shown below)

3. **Commit when satisfied**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: Add orchestrator submodule documentation

   - Create orchestrator git submodule structure
   - Add complete documentation (setup, workflows, architecture, etc.)
   - Configure dependencies aligned with amplifier
   - Update amplifier README to reference orchestrator
   - Register as git submodule in .gitmodules

   All documentation written in retcon style (present tense).
   Documentation IS the specification - code implementation follows.

   Reviewed and approved."
   ```

4. **Proceed to Phase 3**:
   ```bash
   /ddd:3-code-plan
   ```
