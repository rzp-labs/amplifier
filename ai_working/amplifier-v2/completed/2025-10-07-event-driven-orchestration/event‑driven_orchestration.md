Great prompt. Here’s a straight‑shooting evaluation of your peer’s “event‑driven orchestration” proposal against our three philosophy docs, plus what I’d adopt now, what I’d defer, and what I’d explicitly avoid.

---

## 1) How well does it fit our philosophy?

**High‑level fit (yes):**

- We already treat the core as **mechanism, not policy** (mount lifecycle, hook/event dispatch, contracts). Using events as a primitive is in‑bounds for the _kernel’s_ role.
- We explicitly favor **open edges, closed center**: the idea that “userland” (orchestrators, schedulers, etc.) can compete/iterate in parallel fits perfectly.
- Our **modular block** approach assumes stable connectors with many interchangeable implementations—the peer’s “multiple ToolResolution schedulers” is exactly that pattern.
- Our logging/observability already uses a **hooked, evented model**; extending the event vocabulary beyond telemetry is structurally compatible.

**Where to be careful (don’t overcorrect):**

- Our kernel philosophy stresses **small, simple, stable** and warns against “framework‑first” designs and core creep. Turning the _entire_ orchestrator contract into a generic event fabric inside the kernel risks collapsing our clear, narrow Protocols (Orchestrator/Provider/Tool) into a single mushy bus. That’s anti‑principle.
- Implementation philosophy tells us to **start minimal, extract interfaces from working examples, avoid future‑proofing**. An up‑front, fully event‑driven _core_ orchestration framework would jump ahead of concrete need.

**Bottom line:**

- **Spirit:** aligned.
- **Letter:** adopt the event‑driven _pattern_ at the **orchestrator/module layer first**, not in the kernel; keep our typed, narrow core Protocols intact. That preserves our “kernel ABI” while enabling the peer’s benefits.

## 2) What from the peer’s idea should we adopt (now), adapt (later), or avoid?

### Adopt now (no kernel change required)

1. **Decision/Resolution “query events” inside the orchestrator**
   Implement an _event‑shaped_ decision API _within the orchestrator module_ for:

   - `ToolResolution.requested` → schedulers propose `{tool, args, score}`
   - `AgentResolution.requested` → schedulers propose `{agent, rationale, score}`
   - `ContextResolution.requested` → policies propose `{compaction, retrieval, limits}`
     The orchestrator aggregates proposals (priority/vote/score) and proceeds. Kernel stays unaware; this is orchestrator policy, which is correct. (Mechanism vs policy.)

2. **A compact, named decision vocabulary** (in userland)
   Publish a tiny set of **decision event names** (the three above + explicit error conditions) alongside the existing lifecycle/telemetry events we already use for logging. This mimics the peer’s “compact set of core events” _without_ moving them into the kernel’s contract yet.

3. **Multiple competing metaschedulers as modules**
   Encourage several “resolution” modules (e.g., simple heuristic, cost‑aware, latency‑aware, “pick best MCP”, etc.). This squarely matches our **modular competition at the edges** principle.

4. **Synchronous UX on top, async variants as alternate orchestrators**
   Keep the default loop simple (sync, single‑threaded—boringly reliable), but add an _alternate_ evented/async orchestrator module later. This lets teams pick UX/perf tradeoffs without touching core. (Simple first, then fast.)

### Adapt later (behind a flag / after 2–3 concrete implementations)

5. **A generic “Query Hook” mechanism (optional)**
   If the pattern proves out across 2–3 orchestrators/schedulers, consider a **kernel‑level extension to HookRegistry** that supports _query_ semantics (gather handler returns with deterministic reduction + timeout). Keep it **mechanical** (no scheduling policy), and make it **additive** to the current fire‑and‑forget hooks so telemetry remains non‑interfering. This respects “interfaces are forever (or close).”

6. **Standardize resolution event names** in a public “decision taxonomy”
   Once there’s real usage, freeze names like `decision:tool`, `decision:agent`, `decision:context` and their common fields for interop. Do this **outside the kernel first** (docs + conformance tests), then bless them if stability emerges. (Golden compatibility mindset.)

### Avoid (conflicts with our philosophy)

7. **Replacing core Protocols with a pure event fabric**
   Don’t weaken typed, narrow interfaces (Orchestrator/Provider/Tool/Context) into generic event handlers. We’d lose clarity, debuggability, and stability guarantees our kernel depends on. (Narrow contracts > feature‑rich surfaces.)

8. **Pushing scheduling policy into the kernel**
   Kernel offers mechanism (dispatch, IDs, isolation). _What_ tool to pick, _how_ to arbitrate interference, and _when_ to parallelize live in modules/orchestrators. (Mechanism, not policy.)

---

## 3) Concretely: how to realize the peer’s benefits without changing our philosophy

### A. Event‑shaped orchestration inside the orchestrator (today)

**Shape:**

```text
orchestrator.run_step(ctx):
  # Emit a decision request (userland bus inside the orchestrator)
  proposals = decision_bus.ask("ToolResolution.requested", {ctx, candidates, constraints}, timeout=250ms)

  choice = reduce(proposals)  # e.g., highest score, policy chain, or veto rule
  act(choice)
```

- **decision_bus**: a thin orchestrator‑local helper (not kernel API).
- **proposals**: array of `{module, score, rationale, plan, risk}`.
- **reduce**: deterministic reducer (documented priority/vote semantics).
- **No kernel change.** We simply publish the request/response payload schema and let metascheduler modules subscribe (through orchestrator’s plug‑in points or the existing hook system if you prefer).

### B. Tool interference handling (in userland)

- Add a **`ToolConcurrencyPolicy` module** the orchestrator consults before dispatch: it can maintain soft locks (by resource/type), serialize conflicting tools, or batch compatible ones. This stays policy‑side and keeps the core small. (Safety + least privilege at the edges.)

### C. Error‑first event coverage (we already have the pattern)

- Extend our lifecycle/telemetry set with explicit **error events** (`provider:error`, `tool:error`, `decision:error`) that our logging hook already knows how to capture—this is already aligned with the logging system.

### D. Async/scale path without core changes

- Ship a **`loop-evented`** orchestrator variant that uses the same decision events but runs a small task scheduler (queues, timeouts, cancellation). Distributed options can emerge as separate orchestrators later. (Keep kernel sync and minimal; measure at the edges.)

## 4) Risks & mitigations

| Risk                     | If we push evented orchestration into kernel                                | Mitigation (recommended path)                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core creep & instability | Kernel surfaces “resolution” policies; harder to keep “interfaces forever.” | Keep decision semantics in orchestrator; add an **optional** kernel Query Hook only if repeated need appears.             |
| Loss of clarity          | Typed Protocols dissolve into ad‑hoc event handlers.                        | Preserve Provider/Tool/Context Protocols; use decision events only for **selection**, not for raw I/O execution.          |
| Premature complexity     | Big framework first, value later.                                           | Follow **implementation philosophy**: ship concrete orchestrator + 2–3 schedulers, then extract minimal common mechanism. |

## 5) What to tell your peer (and our internal guidance)

- **We agree on the direction**: event‑shaped orchestration is a powerful way to get scalability, sync/async flexibility, and deep extensibility.
- **We’ll realize it at the edges first** (orchestrator + metascheduler modules), keeping the kernel small and stable. That preserves our _Unix/Linux‑style_ center with **mechanism only**—dispatch, IDs, hook dispatch, no policy.
- **If the pattern hardens**, we can add a tiny, **additive** kernel “Query Hook” mechanism to standardize _how_ results are gathered (not _which_ to choose). (Interfaces evolve additively.)
- Meanwhile, our **logging/hook infrastructure** already supports the telemetry side of the peer’s suggestion, so we’ll add the missing error events and IDs there (no core change).

---

## 6) Action checklist (zero core changes required)

1. **Publish Decision Event Schemas** (userland docs): `ToolResolution.requested/fulfilled/aborted`, `AgentResolution.*`, `ContextResolution.*` with common fields (context snapshot, candidates, constraints, `deadline_ms`, etc.).
2. **Implement `decision_bus` helper** inside the default orchestrator (sync ask/collect/reduce with timeout).
3. **Ship two metascheduler modules** (e.g., _simple heuristic_ and _cost/latency‑aware_) to validate the interface.
4. **Extend error events** in the telemetry taxonomy and ensure the logging hook captures them (we already have the JSONL schema path).
5. **Evaluate** after 2–3 real usages; if stable, propose a minimal **Query Hook** in the kernel as a _mechanism_ (additive, optional).

## 7) Net: keep our philosophy, embrace the pattern at the edges

Your peer’s idea is **compatible** with our direction and can be realized **without changing the kernel philosophy**. We should **not** shift scheduling policy into the core or replace our narrow Protocols with a generic event fabric. Instead, adopt event‑shaped decisions **inside orchestrators**, let metaschedulers compete as modules, and—only after evidence—consider a **small, additive** kernel mechanism to standardize “ask/collect/reduce.” That keeps us true to **mechanism‑not‑policy**, **small/stable core**, and **parallel innovation at the edges**.
