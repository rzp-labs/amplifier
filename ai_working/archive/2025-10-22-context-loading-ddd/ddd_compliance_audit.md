- Users won't discover @mention capabilities or REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
- Risk of context poisoning if docs aren't updated

## Critical Issues

### ARCHITECTURE.md Missing
**File**: amplifier-dev/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md
**Status**: ❌ File doesn't exist but is in audit checklist
**Issue**: Referenced in multiple places but file is missing
**Impact**: Context poisoning - docs reference non-existent file
**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Remove from audit checklist (not part of implementation)
2. Create the file with architecture overview
3. Update references that point to it

## Major Issues
None identified yet.

## Minor Issues

### amplifier-dev/README.md
**Status**: ⚠️ Incomplete
**Issues**:
- Does NOT mention @mention system (new feature)
- Does NOT mention REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
- References "next" branch for amplifier submodule (verify if correct)
**Recommendation**:
- Add Quick Start section mentioning @mention capabilities
- Add brief mention of REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1 in architecture section
- Verify branch reference is correct

### amplifier-dev/AGENTS.md
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs update
**Issues**:
- Provider contract still says "ChatRequest → ChatResponse" but doesn't explain REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
- No mention of developer message role with XML wrapping
- No mention of @mention loading architecture
**Recommendation**:
- Update Module Types Reference table to explain REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
- Add section about @mention processing architecture
- Update provider contract details to mention developer messages

## Files in Perfect Alignment

### amplifier-dev/docs/CONTEXT_LOADING.md
**Status**: ✅ Excellent
**Analysis**:
- Comprehensive documentation of @mention system
- Accurate description of implementation
- Clear examples and troubleshooting
- Properly describes architecture layers (kernel utils, shared lib, app layer)
- Correctly explains provider-specific handling
- XML wrapper format documented accurately
**Philosophy**: Perfectly aligned with KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY - mentions placed in kernel utils (mechanism) vs app layer (policy)

### amplifier-dev/docs/context/KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY.md
**Status**: ✅ Perfect
**Analysis**:
- No changes needed for @mention implementation
- Philosophy correctly guides implementation
- @mention placement (utils/mentions.py in kernel) aligns with "mechanism not policy" principle
**Philosophy**: This file IS the philosophy - correctly applied to implementation

## Detailed Findings

### File: amplifier-dev/README.md
**Status**: ⚠️ Minor updates needed
**Issues**:
1. Missing mention of new @mention feature
2. Missing mention of REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
3. Branch reference needs verification
**Recommendation**:
- Add to Quick Start: "Profiles support @mention to load context files"
- Add to Architecture: "Uses REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1 for provider communication"
- Verify "next" branch is correct for amplifier submodule

### File: amplifier-dev/AGENTS.md
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs updates for new features
**Issues**:
1. Provider contract description doesn't mention REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1 details
2. No architecture section for @mention processing
3. Missing developer message role information
**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Module Types Reference - Provider row should mention:
- Contract: `ChatRequest → ChatResponse` (REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1)
- Supports: ContentBlock types (text, thinking, tool_use, tool_result)
- Handles: Developer messages with XML wrapping
```

### File: amplifier-dev/docs/context/KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY.md
**Status**: ✅ No changes needed
**Analysis**: Philosophy document correctly guided the implementation. The @mention implementation demonstrates the philosophy:
- parse_mentions() in kernel = mechanism (pure text parsing)
- MentionLoader in shared lib = reusable capability
- Integration in app layer = policy
This is EXACTLY how kernel philosophy should work.

### File: amplifier-dev/docs/CONTEXT_LOADING.md
**Status**: ✅ Excellent documentation
**Analysis**: Comprehensive guide covering:
- ✅ How @mentions work (accurate)
- ✅ File resolution (correct search paths)
- ✅ Recursive loading (accurate)
- ✅ Deduplication (correctly explained)
- ✅ Provider-specific handling (accurate for Anthropic/OpenAI)
- ✅ XML wrapper format (correct)
- ✅ Architecture layers (correctly identifies kernel utils, shared lib, app layer)
**Philosophy**: Perfectly demonstrates kernel philosophy - mechanism vs policy separation

### File: amplifier-dev/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md
**Status**: ❌ File doesn't exist
**Issue**: Multiple documents reference this file but it doesn't exist
**Impact**: Broken references, context poisoning
**Recommendation**:
1. Remove references to this file, OR
2. Create it with system architecture overview

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Issue (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Decision needed**: Remove from audit checklist OR create the file
- If creating: Add architecture overview showing @mention flow and REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1
- If removing: Update all references to this non-existent file

### Priority 2: Update High-Traffic Documentation
**Files needing immediate updates**:

1. **amplifier-dev/AGENTS.md** - Add to Module Types Reference:
   ```markdown
   | **Provider** | LLM backends | `ChatRequest → ChatResponse` (REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1) | anthropic, openai, azure, ollama | Supports ContentBlocks (text, thinking, reasoning, tool_use, tool_result); Developer messages with XML wrapping |
   ```

2. **amplifier-dev/README.md** - Add feature highlights:
   ```markdown
   ## Key Features
   - **@Mention System**: Load context files with `@filename.md` in profiles and chat
   - **REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1**: Type-safe message handling with Pydantic models
   - **Modular Architecture**: Swap providers, tools, orchestrators independently
   ```

### Priority 3: Verify Remaining Documentation
**Recommended approach**:
- Spot-check submodule READMEs for completeness (10 files)
- Verify bundled profile files reflect @mention capabilities (already done in implementation)
- Confirm provider-specific docs mention ChatRequest support

## Philosophy Compliance Assessment

### ✅ EXCELLENT: Implementation Follows Kernel Philosophy

The @mention system demonstrates **perfect adherence** to kernel philosophy:

**Mechanism vs Policy Separation**:
- `parse_mentions()` in `amplifier_core/utils/mentions.py` = **mechanism** (pure text parsing, no file I/O)
- `MentionLoader` in shared library = **capability** (reusable, no policy)
- App layer integration = **policy** (when/how to load, search paths)

**Key Quote from KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY.md**:
> "If something can plausibly be a policy, it should live in a module, not in core."

✅ **The implementation does exactly this**. The kernel provides parse_mentions() as a mechanism. The app layer decides the policy (search paths, when to load, error handling).

**REQUEST_ENVELOPE_V1 Compliance**:
- Stable contract (Pydantic models)
- Versioned schema
- No policy in core
- Providers adapt to contract

**This is a textbook example of correct kernel design.**

---

## Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **Implementation is philosophically sound**

The code changes demonstrate excellent architectural discipline:
1. Kernel provides mechanisms (parse_mentions, MESSAGE models)
2. Shared libraries provide capabilities (MentionLoader)
3. App layer implements policy (search paths, loading strategy)
4. Providers adapt to stable contracts

**Documentation Status**: ⚠️ **Needs targeted updates**

Critical documentation (CONTEXT_LOADING.md, REQUEST_ENVELOPE_MODELS.md) is excellent. High-traffic entry points (README.md, AGENTS.md) need minor updates to highlight new features.

**Recommendation for Push**: ✅ **Safe to push with Priority 1 & 2 updates**

The implementation is solid. Fix the missing ARCHITECTURE.md reference and update the two high-traffic docs, then push with confidence.
