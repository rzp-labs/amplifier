# Amplifier: Metacognitive AI Development

> _"Automate complex workflows by describing how you think through them."_

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is a research demonstrator. It is in early development and may change significantly. Using permissive AI tools in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk. See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

Amplifier is a coordinated and accelerated development system that turns your expertise into reusable AI tools without requiring code. Describe the step-by-step thinking process for handling a task‚Äîa "metacognitive recipe"‚Äîand Amplifier builds a tool that executes it reliably. As you create more tools, they combine and build on each other, transforming individual solutions into a compounding automation system.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone Amplifier repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier.git amplifier
cd amplifier

# Install dependencies
make install

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac/WSL
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
```

### Get Started

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude
```

**Create your first tool in 5 steps:**

1. **Identify a task** you want to automate (e.g., "weekly learning digest")

   Need ideas? Try This:

   ```
   /ultrathink-task I'm new to "metacognitive recipes". What are some useful
   tools I could create with Amplifier that show how recipes can self-evaluate
   and improve via feedback loops? Just brainstorm ideas, don't build them yet.
   ```

2. **Describe the thinking process** - How would an expert handle it step-by-step?

   Need help? Try This:

   ```
   /ultrathink-task This is my idea: <your idea here>. Can you help me describe the
   thinking process to handle it step-by-step?
   ```

   Example of a metacognitive recipe:

   ```markdown
   I want to create a tool called "Research Synthesizer". Goal: help me research a topic by finding sources, extracting key themes, then asking me to choose which themes to explore in depth, and finally producing a summarized report.

   Steps:

   1. Do a preliminary web research on the topic and collect notes.
   2. Extract the broad themes from the notes.
   3. Present me the list of themes and highlight the top 2-3 you recommend focusing on (with reasons).
   4. Allow me to refine or add to that theme list.
   5. Do in-depth research on the refined list of themes.
   6. Draft a report based on the deep research, ensuring the report stays within my requested length and style.
   7. Offer the draft for my review and incorporate any feedback.
   ```

3. **Generate with `/ultrathink-task`** - Let Amplifier build the tool

   ```
   /ultrathink-task <your metacognitive recipe here>
   ```

4. **Refine through feedback** - "Make connections more insightful"

   ```
   Let's see how it works. Run <your generated tool>.
   ```

   Then:

   - Observe and note issues.
   - Provide feedback in context.
   - Iterate until satisfied.

## ‚ú® Features To Try

### üîß Create Amplifier-powered Tools for Scenarios

Amplifier is designed so **you can create new AI-powered tools** just by describing how they should think. See the [Create Your Own Tools](docs/CREATE_YOUR_OWN_TOOLS.md) guide for more information.

- _Tell Claude Code:_ `Walk me through creating my own scenario tool`

- _View the documentation:_ [Scenario Creation Guide](docs/CREATE_YOUR_OWN_TOOLS.md)

### üé® Design Intelligence

Amplifier includes comprehensive design intelligence with 7 specialist agents, evidence-based design knowledge, and orchestrated design workflows:

- _Tell Claude Code:_

  `/designer create a button component with hover states and accessibility`

  `Use the art-director agent to establish visual direction for my app`

  `Deploy component-designer to create a reusable card component`

- _Available Design Specialists:_
  - **animation-choreographer** - Motion design and transitions
  - **art-director** - Aesthetic strategy and visual direction
  - **component-designer** - Component design and creation
  - **design-system-architect** - Design system architecture
  - **layout-architect** - Information architecture and layout
  - **responsive-strategist** - Device adaptation and responsive design
  - **voice-strategist** - Voice & tone for UI copy

- _Design Framework:_
  - **9 Dimensions** - Purpose, hierarchy, color, typography, spacing, responsive, accessibility, motion, voice
  - **4 Layers** - Foundational, structural, behavioral, experiential
  - **Evidence-based** - WCAG 2.1, color theory, animation principles, accessibility standards

- _View the documentation:_ [Design Intelligence](docs/design/README.md)

### ü§ñ Explore Amplifier's agents on your code

Try out one of the specialized experts:

- _Tell Claude Code:_

  `Use the zen-architect agent to design my application's caching layer`

  `Deploy bug-hunter to find why my login system is failing`

  `Have security-guardian review my API implementation for vulnerabilities`

- _View the files:_ [Agents](.claude/agents/)

### üìù Document-Driven Development

**Why use this?** Eliminate doc drift and context poisoning. When docs lead and code follows, your specifications stay perfectly in sync with reality.

Execute a complete feature workflow with numbered slash commands:

```bash
/ddd:1-plan         # Design the feature
/ddd:2-docs         # Update all docs (iterate until approved)
/ddd:3-code-plan    # Plan code changes
/ddd:4-code         # Implement and test (iterate until working)
/ddd:5-finish       # Clean up and finalize
```

Each phase creates artifacts the next phase reads. You control all git operations with explicit authorization at every step. The workflow prevents expensive mistakes by catching design flaws before implementation.

- _Tell Claude Code:_ `/ddd:0-help`

- _View the documentation:_ [Document-Driven Development Guide](docs/document_driven_development/)

### üå≥ Parallel Development

**Why use this?** Stop wondering "what if" ‚Äî build multiple solutions simultaneously and pick the winner.

```bash
# Try different approaches in parallel
make worktree feature-jwt     # JWT authentication approach
make worktree feature-oauth   # OAuth approach in parallel

# Compare and choose
make worktree-list            # See all experiments
make worktree-rm feature-jwt  # Remove the one you don't want
```

Each worktree is completely isolated with its own branch, environment, and context.

See the [Worktree Guide](docs/WORKTREE_GUIDE.md) for advanced features, such as hiding worktrees from VSCode when not in use, adopting branches from other machines, and more.

- _Tell Claude Code:_ `What make worktree commands are available to me?`

- _View the documentation:_ [Worktree Guide](docs/WORKTREE_GUIDE.md)

### üìä Enhanced Status Line

See costs, model, and session info at a glance:

**Example**: `~/repos/amplifier (main ‚Üí origin) Opus 4.1 üí∞$4.67 ‚è±18m`

Shows:

- Current directory and git branch/status
- Model name with cost-tier coloring (red=high, yellow=medium, blue=low)
- Running session cost and duration

Enable with:

```
/statusline use the script at .claude/tools/statusline-example.sh
```

### üí¨ Conversation Transcripts

**Never lose context again.** Amplifier automatically exports your entire conversation before compaction, preserving all the details that would otherwise be lost. When Claude Code compacts your conversation to stay within token limits, you can instantly restore the full history.

**Automatic Export**: A PreCompact hook captures your conversation before any compaction event:

- Saves complete transcript with all content types (messages, tool usage, thinking blocks)
- Timestamps and organizes transcripts in `.data/transcripts/`
- Works for both manual (`/compact`) and auto-compact events

**Easy Restoration**: Use the `/transcripts` command in Claude Code to restore your full conversation:

```
/transcripts  # Restores entire conversation history
```

The transcript system helps you:

- **Continue complex work** after compaction without losing details
- **Review past decisions** with full context
- **Search through conversations** to find specific discussions
- **Export conversations** for sharing or documentation

**Transcript Commands** (via Makefile):

```bash
make transcript-list                # List available transcripts
make transcript-search TERM="auth"  # Search past conversations
make transcript-restore             # Restore full lineage (for CLI use)
```

### üèóÔ∏è Workspace Pattern for Serious Projects

**For long-term development**, consider using the workspace pattern where Amplifier hosts your project as a git submodule. This architectural approach provides:

- **Clean boundaries** - Project files stay in project directory, Amplifier stays pristine and updatable
- **Version control isolation** - Each component maintains independent git history
- **Context persistence** - AGENTS.md preserves project guidance across sessions
- **Scalability** - Work on multiple projects simultaneously without interference
- **Philosophy alignment** - Project-specific decision filters and architectural principles

Perfect for:

- Projects that will live for months or years
- Codebases with their own git repository
- Teams collaborating on shared projects
- When you want to update Amplifier without affecting your projects
- Working on multiple projects that need isolation

The pattern inverts the typical relationship: instead of your project containing Amplifier, Amplifier becomes a dedicated workspace that hosts your projects. Each project gets persistent context through AGENTS.md (AI guidance), philosophy documents (decision filters), and clear namespace boundaries using `@project-name/` syntax.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development Commands

```bash
make check            # Format, lint, type-check
make test             # Run tests
make ai-context-files # Rebuild AI context
```

### üß™ Testing & Benchmarks

Testing and benchmarking are critical to ensuring that any product leveraging AI, including Amplifier, is quantitatively measured for performance and reliability.
Currently, we leverage [terminal-bench](https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench) to reproducibly benchmark Amplifier against other agents.
Further details on how to run the benchmark can be found in [tests/terminal_bench/README.md](tests/terminal_bench/README.md).
