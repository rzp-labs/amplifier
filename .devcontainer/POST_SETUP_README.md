# Welcome to the project Codespace

The steps below will help you get started with the project.

## Post-Create Setup

## How to use

- Launch a new Terminal session
- Run `./.devcontainer/post-create.sh`, this will:
  - ✅ Set up development environment
  - ✅ Install the Claude CLI (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
  - ✅ Configure Git settings (auto-setup remote on push)
- Upon completion of script, activate the changes with `source ~/.bashrc`
- Launch Amplifier by running Claude Code: `claude`

**Container Name**: The dev container is configured to always use the name `amplifier_devcontainer` in Docker Desktop (instead of random names like "sharp_galois").

### Verifying Installation

To verify everything installed correctly:

```bash
# Check Claude CLI is installed
claude --version

# View the post-create logs
cat /tmp/devcontainer-post-create.log
```

If the `claude` command is not found, the post-create script may have failed. Check the logs at `/tmp/devcontainer-post-create.log` for details, or manually run:

```bash
./.devcontainer/post-create.sh
```

See the [README](../README.md) for more details on how to use the project.
